# Phase 3 Implementation Plan: Service Integration

## Overview
Phase 3 focuses on integrating the Phase 1 (database functions) and Phase 2 (service layer) implementations into a cohesive, thread-safe conflict box management system.

## Implementation Strategy
- **Incremental Development**: Each step builds on the previous one
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Test each component before proceeding
- **Thread Safety First**: Prioritize race condition prevention
- **No Breaking Changes**: Maintain backward compatibility

## Phase 3A: Core Integration Service
1. Create `ConflictBoxIntegrationService` that coordinates queue and lock managers
2. Implement thread-safe operations
3. Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
4. Test basic integration

## Phase 3B: Thread Safety and Race Condition Prevention
1. Implement proper locking mechanisms
2. Add connection pool monitoring
3. Implement retry logic for transient failures
4. Test concurrent operations

## Phase 3C: Advanced Features
1. Add performance monitoring
2. Implement health checks
3. Add configuration management
4. Final integration testing

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for each new component
- Integration tests for the complete system
- Stress tests for concurrent operations
- Performance benchmarks

## Risk Mitigation
- Each step is tested independently
- Rollback plan for each phase
- Comprehensive logging for debugging
- No changes to existing working components
